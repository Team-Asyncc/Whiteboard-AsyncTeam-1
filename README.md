Async Whiteboard is a cloud-enabled, offline-storage compatible, VanillaJS-powered HTML5 Canvas Whiteboarding tool.

- ✨Magic ✨

## Deployment
[Whiteboard](https://team-asyncc.github.io/Whiteboard-AsyncTeam-1/)

## Features

- The pencil tool can be used to draw with a slider for size variation.
- Eraser tool is also available to erase any mistakes with varying sizes as per your need.
- The clear tool helps to clear all the drawing from the canvas.
- Undo feature is used to clear your last mistake just like plain old Ctrl+Z
- You can also use a Color picker to use different colors for your pen.
- Export documents as png is also available, because, why not?
- Shapes of different colour can also be added, because drawing a circle is not that easy.
- We also ship a straight line making tool, because our team realized, mouses are not very good for straight lines.

## Tech
- [HTML5](https://htmlreference.io) - Plain old markup!
- [CSS3](https://cssreference.io) - Because Cascade is king!
- [VanillaJS](https://javascript.com) - Because interactivity.
